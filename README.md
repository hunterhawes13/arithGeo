## Synopsis

####JavaScript Challenge

Using the JavaScript language, have the function ArithGeoII(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and return the string "Arithmetic" if the sequence follows an arithmetic pattern or return "Geometric" if it follows a geometric pattern. If the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return -1. An arithmetic sequence is one where the difference between each of the numbers is consistent, where as in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by some constant or common ratio. Arithmetic example: [2, 4, 6, 8] and Geometric example: [2, 6, 18, 54]. Negative numbers may be entered as parameters, 0 will not be entered, and no array will contain all the same elements. 

This challenge requires you to determine if the integers in an array follow either an arithmetic or geometric sequence. An arithmetic sequence is one where the difference between each successive pair of integers is constant, for example in the array [2, 4, 6, 8] the difference between the integers is always 2. A geometric sequence is one where each element in the array is the product of the previous integer multiplied by some constant or ratio, for example in the array [3, 9, 27, 81] each element is a result of the previous element multiplied by 3.

A simple solution to this challenge involves checking the difference between each pair of integers.

## Code Example

```
function ArithGeo(arr) { 

  // this function will loop through the provided array
  // checking to see if the difference provided matches
  // every element-pair difference in the array
  function arrayDiffs(diff, arr, subtract) {

    // loop starting from i=2 and check if every difference is the same
    for (var i = 2; i < arr.length; i++) { 

      // store the temporary difference 
      var tempDiff = (subtract) ? arr[i] - arr[i-1] : arr[i] / arr[i-1];

      // if differences do not match return false
      if (tempDiff !== diff) { return false; }

      // if we reach the end of the array and all differences matched, return true
      else if (i === arr.length-1 && tempDiff === diff) { return true; }

    }

  }

  // store the first difference for a potential arithmetic sequence
  var diffArith = arr[1] - arr[0];

  // store the first difference for a potential geometric sequence
  var diffGeo = arr[1] / arr[0];

  // check the whole array for an arithmetic sequence
  var isArithSeq = arrayDiffs(diffArith, arr, true);
  
  // if not an arithmetic sequence, check for geometric sequence
  if (!isArithSeq) {

    var isGeoSeq = arrayDiffs(diffGeo, arr, false);
    return (isGeoSeq) ? "Geometric" : -1;

  } else {

    return "Arithmetic";

  }
         
}
   
ArithGeo([3, 9, 27, 81]); 
```
